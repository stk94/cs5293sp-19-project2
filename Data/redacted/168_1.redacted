Despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential. Set as a prequel to the original "█████████" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, ███████████, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a "█████████" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint). The actual show-runner, █████████████, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck). Never have I seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors (███████████████ excepted)last so long. It is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires. Unfortunately it appears as if ██████ and █████ have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at Paramount that "Enterprise" suffered from "franchise fatigue" and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off. Produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come.<br /><br />██████ put, In a TeeVee universe where we are given shows like "Battlestar: █████████" and "The Shield" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a "█████████" that measures up and is dramatically competitive. It is just that straightforward and easy.
