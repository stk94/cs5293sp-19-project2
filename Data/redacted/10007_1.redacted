This film is mediocre at best. ████████████ is as funny as a bag of hammers. Her bitchy demeanor from "Law and █████" carries over in a failed attempt at comedy. █████████████ is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to come out of this mess is ███████ and ██████'s marriage. █████████ that effort produces better results.
