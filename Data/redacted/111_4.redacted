My interest in Dorothy Stratten caused me to purchase this video. Although it had great actors/actresses, there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest. Plus it just wasn't that interesting. ████████ was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of ██████████████'s last movies. I'll always love ███████████ best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
