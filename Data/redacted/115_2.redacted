Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! █████████'s "Star 80" about ████████████████, of whom ███████████ was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times more interesting than ███████ herself on the silver screen. ████████████ is no actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la ████████████ but instead got ██████████████ cavorting in jeans and a god-awful "poodlesque" hair-do....Very disappointing...."██████████" and "The Last Picture Show" I could watch again and again. This clunker I could barely sit through once. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. ████████'s tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so bad!
