Pathetic... worse than a bad made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that ██████ and ███████ were in this flick. For some reason ██████████████'s character is constantly talking about and saying "pussy" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. ██████████████ calling women "pussy" is just awkward... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting, confusing camera angles, a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />I rented this flop with low expectations.... but... well... it really sucked.
