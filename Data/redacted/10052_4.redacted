██████ Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of ██████'s few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work. ██████████████████ plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences. ████████ gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, ██████████████ and █████████████ are good, but the bad acting of █████████████ and ███████████████ in the second leads really hurts the movie. █████ is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations. ██████████'s camera work is strong. Somehow, this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for ████████████ (in a year that gave us "M," "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
