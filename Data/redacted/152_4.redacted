You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilers.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but █████████ didn't deserve to win any Oscar for this piece, and I think the Academy was right in that vote. (Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such... that I don't know about. But it would be hard to justify, given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product.) The way █████████ directs this is so contrived, so meddlesome. While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as ███ course I have taken was screaming at me: "Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered. Sentimentality is sugary and unreal, a false view of life." This is over-the-top sentimentality. When in real life to two people ever begin to read out loud in synchronicity, as █████ and ██████████ do when sitting on the bed going over the letters from Nettie they have found? There are examples of this type of faux behavior throughout the film: all the men crowding around ███████████'s car and then jumping in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes to drive away; █████ falling through the roofs of various buildings he's working on (a cheap slapstick gag); the whole troop of revelers heading from the Jook Joint en masse to the chapel, as if magically entranced by the choir's singing... on and on. Nothing rings true. I even wondered if █████'s name was chosen purposefully because it's his wife ██████'s real name, "Oprah," backwards. █████████ isn't above such "cuteness."<br /><br />It's not that █████████ is incapable of honestly rendered action and emotion. █████████'s ████ was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I greatly admire Saving Private Ryan too for its realism, even if the story is a bit contrived.
