███ ██████ stars as ███████████ and his look-alike, gambler man ███████████. ██████ "Gabby" █████ is ██████████'s ex-pal, █████████████. ██████████ (█████████████) and ███████████ (████████████) are a noteworthy team, as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero.<br /><br />Of course, mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development, since Rogers essays a "dual role". Rogers is charming, as usual; but, there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll/Hyde performance is done in by poor material. The better pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as the St. Louis Journal reporters - they are the film's highlight. The songs are fine, though badly synched. <br /><br />*** ███████████ at Bay (1941) ███████████ ~ Roy Rogers, ██████ 'Gabby' █████, ██████████
