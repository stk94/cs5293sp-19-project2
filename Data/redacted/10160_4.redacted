A typical █████ flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify █████'s MGM contract at the time.<br /><br />As reported by member Lastliberal (above) ███████ could not stand █████ because of his obscene advances towards her off (and sometimes on) camera. In addition, his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable. After doing their second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans", the normally quiet ███████ stormed into ██████████████'s office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with █████ again Â– period. █████ felt that ███████ was much more valuable to MGM then █████, so ███████'s statement stuck. ███████ went on to star in a number of widely received (and far more profitable) musicals with ███████████ and others. Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and ████ her reply was that there was no comparison between them, and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the "real people" in the audiences.
