I rented this movie last week. I saw ████████████ and ██████████████ were on it, so it seemed promising. And it was, until █████████████████ came on scene. He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again. I mean, he is one of the most boring, uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever. Why the hell was he cast for the role of ████████████? I think ██████████ would have been a better choice.<br /><br />████████████ was another big disappointment. His character is so dull, it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and ████████ in Se7en. It might sound cool, but believe me, it's not.<br /><br />Now, ███████████████'s acting is very good. It's about one of the very few good things about this movie. He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan ███████ is good but nothing special. He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story, although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good. I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov (███████████████) was killed, but nothing really happened.
