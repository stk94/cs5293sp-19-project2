Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, ███████████████ was terrific as ███████, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: "███████████████ to everyone!" Other times I almost fell asleep.<br /><br />The movie is based on a ███████████████ short story about a rich guy, who don't think █████████ is nothing but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate █████████ after all.<br /><br />I can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. Instead of this piece of garbage, I recommend to you, the ███████████ comedy Scrooged. That at least, was funny...
