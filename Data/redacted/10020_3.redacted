█████ ███████████████'s '██████' is a over-hyped, stylized, product. Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. ██████ is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash █████████' and ██████████ appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. ██████ down! <br /><br />Performances: ███████████, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? ████████████ is great actor, in fact he's the sole saving grace. ██████████████ has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. █████████████ doesn't get his due in here. █████████████, ███████████ and ██████████████ are wasted.<br /><br />'Tashan' is a boring film. The films failure at the box office, should you keep away.
