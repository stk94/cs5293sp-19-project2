First lesson that some film makers (particularly those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - just 'style' does not sell. I guess ██████ when translated will mean style. Second, if you are hell bent on selling style, that does not spare you from having a decent story.<br /><br />Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director. But it is not slick. For example, all three - Saif, ███████ and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story. But this setup is not utilized to properly. There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations. Actions sequences are from the seventies.<br /><br />Cheoreography of the film is awful. I think █████████████████ just sleep walked through this film. Vishal-Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film. Why is there a sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why is the cool Hinglish song (Dil Dance Maare) not on ███████████ when he is the one who is English crazy? <br /><br />████████████ is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped self. You won't mind missing this film.
