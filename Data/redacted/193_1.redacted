The story by ██████████████ is a masterwork; ███████'s film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the ███████ brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, █████████, trying to play the charismatic ████████████, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, ████████████ as the father and █████████████ as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.
