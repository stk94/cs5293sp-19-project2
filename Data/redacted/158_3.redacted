Warning Spoilers following. ██████ recreation of the base in Antarctica where the real events of the film took place. Other than that, libelous!, scandalous! Filmed in Canada; presumably by a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this film recently on Global television here in Canada. Nothing much to say other than how thoroughly appalled I was at what a blatant piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring ██████████████ of all people! I can only assume that Canadian born director ██████████████████ was coerced to make the USAF the heroes of the film when in fact the real rescuers where a small private airline based in Calgary; ██████████████.
