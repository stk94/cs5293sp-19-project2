If you watched this movie you know why I said "█████, █████, █████". ██████!!! Every time they said "█████, █████, █████"... I laughed thinking "█████, █████, █████, why did I rent this movie"? I cannot believe how █████ winners like ███████ and ██████ appeared here in the background while ██████████ and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is ██████████? Dreaful acting! I think someone like ██████████████ could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for ██████████████ and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called ██████████. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think ████████████████ did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
