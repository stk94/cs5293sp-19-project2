The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when █████████ one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell █████████ who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film █████████████████ ████'s foreign speech pattern is not explained, it's explained here █████████ is her cousin. What's Conn still doing in school, I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she's a beautician.<br /><br />█████████'s a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by ███████████ have him labeled as a nerd. And that's especially bad when ████'s girl friend decides she likes █████████. But being a nerd just isn't going to cut it.<br /><br />That's when █████████ decides to put on a modern day █████ act. He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. If getting █████████████████ is not in the cards, Caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted.<br /><br />Grease 2 introduced █████████████████ and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. If you saw the first Grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.<br /><br />In addition to Conn, █████████, ██████████, and ████████████, all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles. The music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.<br /><br />It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.
