I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a ████raj Film.<br /><br />█████ operates a call centre and one day he is invited by ███████████ to teach her boss, ████████████, English. The two fall in love and decide to run away but █████ tells █████ that she can't do this as she owes a debt to ████████████, who is also known as █████████. But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that █████ finds out that █████████ / ████████████ is a Don. In the meantime, █████████ hires a man, ███████████████, to track down █████ and Pooja.<br /><br />Starring ████ Ali Khan, ██████████████, ███████████ and █████████████, the movie is directed by first time director ████████████████████ and is produced by both █████████████ and ███████████.<br /><br />"██████" has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good and ██████████████ (and her much publicised weight loss) looks good. But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production. With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now.<br /><br />There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to █████████████ and Saif could have definitely done better while ██████████████ played her part well. But this cannot be said for ███████████ - it did not suit him at all as a villain. Lastly,never mind █████████████, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as "███████████," what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? <br /><br />Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression.
