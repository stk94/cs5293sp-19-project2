Today I found "They All Laughed" on VHS on sale in a rental. It was a really old and very used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on its cover: the names of █████████████████, ██████████████, ███████████ and specially ████████████████ attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in "███████████ & ███████████████████ & DVD Guide 2003" and Â– wow Â– four stars! So, I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it. Indeed, I have just finished watching "They All Laughed" and I found it a very boring overrated movie. The characters are badly developed, and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. The plot is supposed to be funny (private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing), but I have not laughed along the whole story. The coincidences, in a huge city like New York, are ridiculous. ███████████ as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt, ████████████████ or ██████████████, is quite ridiculous. In the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year ████████████████, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The ████████████████ Story"; the amazing beauty of the sexy ████████████, the future Mrs. ██████████████; the always wonderful, even being fifty-two years old, ██████████████; and the song "Amigo", from ██████████████. Although I do not like him, ██████████████ has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60's and is called by his fans as "The King". I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (manly Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "██████████ e █████████████" ("Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness")
