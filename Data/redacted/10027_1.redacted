The action in this movie beats █████ bhai in Gadar. ████████████ possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, ███ in Matrix along with █████████ and ████████. It is hilarious. Except for the typical ████████████ and ███████████ comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that ████████████ long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.
