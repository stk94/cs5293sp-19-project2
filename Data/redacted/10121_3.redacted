█████ Londoners █████████████ and ██████████ (as ████ and ██████████) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic ███████████ (for ███████████) and lonely █████████████ (for Ms. █████). But, they remain as boring as they were before. Arguably bored director ████████████████ tries to liven up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "████ and ███████" by ordering up some camera trickery. An opening homage to King █████'s "The Crowd" is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.<br /><br />*** ████ and Strange (12/10/31) ████████████████ ~ Henry Kendall, ██████████, █████████████, ██████████████
