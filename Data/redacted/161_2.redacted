If you can imagine ████████████ as a New York street pimp, or ██████████ as a Communist spy, then you might believe █████████ as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in Kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />This film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. And the problem is that █████████ made such a big deal about █████████'s refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss █████████████ so you cannot build any anticipation for the "screen consummation" of their love. It's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns.<br /><br />The story is pointless. Even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.<br /><br />April Love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ██████ and Plan 9 from ███████████.
