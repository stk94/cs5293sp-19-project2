When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of ████████████. ███████████'s portrayal of ████ is absolutely awful. ████████████ was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like ████████████ being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better ████, the producers decided to get ███████████. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of ████████████ is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble ████████████, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed ████'s portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, ██████████ playing ██████████ is horrible. ████ does not qualify to play as █████. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although ████ and █████ were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and ██████<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of ████████████, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and ████, read the book from ████████████ herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the Laughter" would be a better choice. The casting of ████████████ and ██████████ in "Before the Laughter" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
