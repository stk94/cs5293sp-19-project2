Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie... I had had a trauma after watching Welcome (2007) and thought that they wont do it again. But after loads of amazing promos, ██████ finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - █████████, ████████ and ███████████..... and what u get in the movie? Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of ████████████ stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching ███████ after her major weight loss...!!!<br /><br />Music-wise another major disaster... in the music album, they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when ████████████ is doing stunts...! that song is such nice, quite comparable to ███████████ and that is not taken in the music album!!! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, i would say, watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ...'Bachchan ███████████████...'<br /><br />Overall very disappointed even with the way █████████ has made attempt to speak bad English!<br /><br />Go away man, i need to puke!
