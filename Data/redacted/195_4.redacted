Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking its flaws this is still an interesting account of the famed and heroic siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. ████████████ as █████████. ███████████ as █████████████. ████████████ as Col. Travis. ██████████ as General Santa Anna. This made-for-TV project also stars ██████████████████, █████████████ and ███████████. Very good original music by ███████████████.
