I never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie, I gotta come really hard on it. Talking about █████, this guy, ███████████████, seems to have completely lost it. After success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos. █████ is so so cheesy that █████████ have left ██████ and ███████ behind.<br /><br />There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say 'Oh! at least this thing is good'. ████████ does clichÃ© in a role of Girl's father, ██████ kapoor looks fat and ██████████, Amrita rao is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets, bad costumes, hackneyed storyline, monstrous stepmother, trying-hard-to-act actors, cacophonous background music, cheap soundtracks.<br /><br />Now the spoiler, I'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies, after a calamitous incidence movie ends on a happy note.
