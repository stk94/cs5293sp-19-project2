████████ ██████ clearly did not want to be in this film, and be forced to play a part-Mexican or he would have been suspended. Believe me , he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "██████████", ███████ tried a follow-up with ███████████ and his usual list of buddies, like █████████, Guinn (Big Boy) ████████, █████████████ and the ever-present ██████████, but they made the huge mistake of trying to present ██████████████ as a love interest for █████ v. ██████████████, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved one thing, and that is she cannot sing. The story was not too bad, but with █████ clearly miscast also, it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have helped.
