Jewish newspaper reporter █████████████████ (as ██████ "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers "Thank you" to testifying officer LL ██████ (as █████████) as he leaves the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. You will see ███ Cool J's devilish detective partner ███████████████ (as Frances "Laz" Lazerov) decide NOT to murder ███████████████████ (as ██████████████). The cops in the city of "██████" are so corrupt they shoot their suspects, steal their money, and snort their dope. Whether he's out to impress his girlfriend (herein, called "Pussy") or win a Pulitzer, the city's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake.<br /><br />Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption, which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger. Writer/director ██████████████ keeps the film above water, but just barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" sweepstakes (aka the "rapper to actor" progression). █████████████ has fun with his role. Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors ██████████████ (as █████████████) and ████████████ (as █████████████). F.R.A.T. means ██████████████████████ and Tactical, but it's more important to know that "Edison (Force)" stars █████████████████ and LL Cool J, not ██████████████ and ████████████ (who seems lost).<br /><br />**** Edison (9/17/05) ██████████████ ~ █████████████████, LL Cool J, ██████████████, ███████████████
