In an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like ███████████ and ██████ if you know what I did last Friday the 13th, █████████ fails. Why did people like █████████? Because it was original, new and went beyond anything that's ever been done. Why did they like ██████? Because at least it made sense. █████████ is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever. The plot is so similar to █████████ and ████████████ it's not funny. And the moment the killer comes on screen, you know who it is, it's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. The teen slasher genre is DEAD Get over it!<br /><br />0 out of 10
