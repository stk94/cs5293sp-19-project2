I am not so much like █████████ as I image. Finally the film express sexual relationship of ████, kik, █████ their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, ████ waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.Ending up was sad.<br /><br />The director █████████████ was in AMC theatre on Sunday 12:00PM on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. After the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of Romanian were kind of complicate.<br /><br />On my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, I don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. The love proceeding of ████ and ████, and ████ and her brother █████ were kind of next door neighborhood story.<br /><br />The two main reasons I don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? Sounds like after ████ moved into the building which ███i was living, then two girls are fall in love. It doesn't make sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, The whole film didn't have a scene of ████ and Kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what I was waiting forÂ…Â…. However, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. The "ear piercing " part was kind of interesting. ████ was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. That was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. Also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.
