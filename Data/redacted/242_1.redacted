From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even ██████████ can't find his way) "Finding ██████████████" is better left lost. Ms. ██████████'s performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, ████████████ as brother ████ and ████████████ as love interest ████. ███████████████ as ███████, the daughter of single dad ████ is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. █████████████████'s script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like "███████ on 34th Street", ██████████████'s delightful "The shop around the corner" and, of course the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There's ███████████'s classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet ████████". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or " Home for the Holidays" with ████████████ and a great performance by █████████████ Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding "Finding ██████████████". ███████████████!
