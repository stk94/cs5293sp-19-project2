Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to █████'s rather dull and leaden performance. His emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. ████████████ portrayed the role infinitely better. When ███████ was at his meanest, you don't get the sense █████ is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. I cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Very disappointing.
