So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly █████ worthy stuff. █████████████ was hardly a slouch. New scene where ████ finds out █████ is ████████ is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to ██████ make fun of ██████'s version that made more logical sense. The president talks of the Zod "defacing" the Washington monument when it was originally ██████████████. Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd. ████████'s "freedom of the press" line sounded silly compared to "..Care to step outside" which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to █████'s earlier scene in the truck stop. Then there is the ending with the "turn back the world to go back in time" effect. It turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack, N.J. ever went since it doesn't free Zod and company any more.
